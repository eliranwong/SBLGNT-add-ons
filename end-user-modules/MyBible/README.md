<h2>Annotations of clause analysis</h2>
- <b>Adverbial Function (ADV): </b>A constituent that represents when, where, how, or why of a proposition.
- <b>Indirect Object Function (IO): </b>A constituent that represents the intended recipient of the action of a proposition.
- <b>Object Function (O): </b>A constituent that represents the patient or goal of the action of a proposition.
- <b>Second Object Function (O2): </b>Some verbs take two objects. There are two main types. The first type involves two accusative objects in the Greek, an object of person (the first object) and an object of thing (the second object). For example, he will teach you (object of person) all things (object of thing). The second type also involves two accusative objects in the Greek, but the first is the direct object and the second is an object complement. The object complement predicates a description of the direct object (e.g., "king" is the object complement in "God appointed David as king").
- <b>Subject Function (S): </b>A constituent that represents the agent of typically transitive verbs and the single argument of intransitive verbs.
- <b>Predicate Function (P): </b>A constituent that makes an attribution or identification about the Subject of a verbless clause or a verbal clause with a verbal copula.
- <b>Verbal Function (V): </b>A constituent that represents the action/event of a proposition. In verbal clauses, this is the head of the clause, on which all other clause constituents depend.
- <b>Verbal Copula Function (VC): </b>A constituent that facilitates an attribution or identification about the Subject. Verbal copulas are commonly known as copula verbs or linking verbs. This typically corresponds to a “to be” verb in English, which indicates a relation between the Subject and the Predicate rather than any action/event.
